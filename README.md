## Getting started with Windows hosting on Amazon AWS  

As of March 2021, the Amazon AWS controls are not geared toward saving customers money. The setup info and desktop controls avoid giving customers clear options hosting alternative and simple controls to downsize to affordable options.  

For example, there is no clearly stated information that using RDS is the affordable alternative to hosting SQL on the same server as IIS. Nor does phone support did not offer this as a suggestion when attempting to match the prices of other service providers.   

There is also no documentation on how to resolve the error that occurs when making a snapshot once IP addresses have been assigned to a Windows server.

Also beware, turning on notifications does not guarantee you will be notified as costs accure. Check your server billing at least twice a week to make sure you don't have any runaway charges.
